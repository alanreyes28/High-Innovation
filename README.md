### Description: 
The purpose of this project is to detect the temperature of a room across the campus. This is done by having multiple ESP32's equipped with temperature sensors and placing them in different rooms across the campus. 

>The ESP32's may also be placed outside the room, and will read that the temperature is higher than what is expected. Displaying that the AC is not on.

>Devices will also have to go through a calibration mode, where they will get a base reading and make all further measurements accordingly.

The data captured by the ESP32 will be sent to our server and will display on home dashboard of highinnovation.space. 

>Users will also be able to use their phones (albeit android or iphone) to send a custom message and have Siri or Google list out the room and if the AC is on.
