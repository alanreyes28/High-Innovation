### Description: 
The purpose of this project is to detect the temperature of a room across the campus. This is done by having multiple ESP32's equipped with temperature sensors and placing them in different rooms across the campus. 

>The ESP32's may also be placed outside the room, and will read that the temperature is higher than what is expected. Displaying that the AC is not on.

>Devices will also have to go through a calibration mode, where they will get a base reading and make all further measurements accordingly.

The data captured by the ESP32 will be sent to our server and will display on home dashboard of highinnovation.space. 

>Users will also be able to use their phones (albeit android or iphone) to send a custom message and have Siri or Google list out the room and if the AC is on. 

### Tool Set List
>VS Code - streamlined code editor with support for development operations like debugging, task running, and version control.

>>C++ compiler

>>C compiler

>>PlatformIO -compile the same code with different development platforms

>Amazon Web Services (AWS Cloud Server) - cloud platform

>Siri - built-in, voice-controlled personal assistant available for Apple users

>Node-red - programming tool for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services

>>Dashboard

>MongoDB - document database

>Github - code hosting platform for version control and collaboration

>ESP32 - series of low-cost, low-power system on a chip microcontrollers with integrated Wi-Fi and dual-mode Bluetooth

>Temperature sensor LMT84LPGM

>PM2 - Advanced process manager for production Node.js applications

>Powershell - cross-platform task automation solution made up of a command-line shell, a scripting language, and a configuration management framework

>Putty - open-source terminal emulator, serial console and network file transfer application

>Domain name - human-friendly address, sometimes called a URL

>MQTT Broker - entity that enables MQTT clients to communicate
